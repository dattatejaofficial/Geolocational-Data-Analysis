# Geolocational Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing geolocational data using Python, with an emphasis on clustering techniques. The primary objective is to classify locations based on specific features, facilitating insights into spatial data distributions.

## Project Overview

The analysis employs the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data points with similar characteristics. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (`kmeans.ipynb`) that details the clustering process and results.

## Repository Contents

- **kmeans.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm on the dataset.

- **geolocational_data_analysis.html**: An HTML file that likely contains a rendered version of the analysis, possibly including visualizations and explanations.

- **food_coded.csv**: A CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Getting Started

To explore and reproduce the analysis:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teja0006/Geolocational-Data-Analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:

   Ensure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, install necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Execute the Notebook**:

   Open `kmeans.ipynb` and run the cells to perform the clustering analysis.
